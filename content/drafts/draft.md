Proteins are incredible molecular machines. They orchestrate almost all activity in our
biological world. Mastering them has profound effects in our ability to prevent and
cure disease. Though we are only beginning to understand and engineer proteins, a few
recent innovations drove an explosion of progress:

1. DNA Synthesis. We can now quickly and relatively cheaply synthesize any DNA sequence
   and express any protein.
2. DNA Sequencing. Access to an abundance of sequence data far exceeding our ability to
   comprehend them.
3. Computing. Machine learning methods like large language models (enabled by innovations
   in hardware).

These confluent innovations have led us to the exciting age of protein engineering and design.
And the third point is the subject of this blog.

Amino acids make up proteins and specify their structure and function. Over millions of years,
evolution has conducted a massive experiment over the space of all possible amino acid sequences:
sequences that encode a functional protein remain; those that don't are extinct.
