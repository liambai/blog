The [logit lens](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens) is a powerful tool for interpreting LLMs. Can we use it to better understand protein language models?

## The logit lens

Protein language models like ESM-2 are trained with the masked token prediction task. Given a protein sequence:

$$
\text{Q V Q L V [?] S G A}
$$

What is the amino acid at the masked position?

ESM answers this question with 20 numbers (**logits**), one for each possible amino acid. Each logit indicates ESM's confidence level in that amino acid being the masked one. To make a prediction, we pick the amino acid with the highest logit.

Here's the idea of the logit lens: logits can be calculated for not only the last layer (ESM's final answers), but also intermediate layers. Intermediate logits give a view into the information flow through the model, and in some limited sense, its "thought process".

## ESM through the logit lens

### Beta-lactamase

I took a beta-lactamase sequence, masked each position one at a time, and calculated the logits across each layer of ESM-2 (650M):

<TopTokensHeatmap
  title="Beta-lactamase (PDB 4ZAM) top tokens by logit"
  sequence="SPQPLEQIKLSESQLSGRVGMIEMDLASGRTLTAWRADERFPMMSTFKVVLCGAVLARVDAGDEQLERKIHYRQQDLVDYSPVSEKHLADGMTVGELCAAAITMSDNSAANLLLATVGGPAGLTAFLRQIGDNVTRLDRWETELNEALPGDARDTTTPASMAATLRKLLTSQRLSARSQRQLLQWMVDDRVAGPLIRSVLPAGWFIADKTGAGERGARGIVALLGPNNKAERIVVIYLRDTPASMAERNQQIAGIGAALIEHWQR"
  tokensPath="/data/logit-lens/beta_lactamase_top_tokens.csv"
  logitsPath="/data/logit-lens/beta_lactamase_top_logits.csv"
  maxLogit="12.35"
/>

Each cell shows the amino acid ESM is more confident in, colored by its logit value (scroll for more positions, mouseover for logit values). The true amino acid sequence is at the bottom. Red positions are ones where ESM's final prediction is wrong.

- Logits in the early layers tend to be wrong. As we move through the layers, ESM often converges on the right answer.
- By logit values, ESM clearly believes in some positions more than others. For example, it's super confident in position 45 being S––and it's right! The S at position 45 actually constitutes a binding site and is therefore likely highly conserved.

<Figure content={<Image path={require("./images/beta-lactamase-45.png")} />}>
  Beta-lactamse (PDB [4ZAM](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-sequence/4ZAM?asymId=A)) has
  a binding site annotation at position 45. From the structure, we can see that
  this position contacts the ligand, which means that it is likely highly
  conserved.

- Similarly, ESM also believes strongly––and correctly––in D at position 106, another binding site. You can explore more annotations at [https://www.rcsb.org/3d-sequence/4ZAM?asymId=A](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-sequence/4ZAM?asymId=A).

  another binding site annotation at position 106.
</Figure>

- At the first position, ESM is wrong but made a reasonable guess: Methionine (M) corresponds to the start codon so most proteins start with it.

- Sometimes, ESM starts believing in an amino acid in an early layer (e.g. position 29 starting from layer 14). Sometimes, it "changes its mind" at the last layer (position 15).

Of course, looking at the top amino acid has many limitations. What about the other amino acids? If ESM got the final prediction wrong, did it come close by at least giving the true amino acid _one of_ the highest logits?

  ranksPath="/data/logit-lens/beta_lactamase_true_token_ranks.csv"
/>

We can look at that by plotting the rank of the true amino acid among others. In many cases where ESM made the wrong prediction, the correct amino acid was close to the top. For example, at position 5, the correct amino acid corresponds to ESM's second highest logit.

### Antibody

I repeated this for an antibody heavy chain sequence.

<TopTokensHeatmap

  tokensPath="/data/logit-lens/ab_heavy_chain_top_tokens.csv"
  logitsPath="/data/logit-lens/ab_heavy_chain_top_logits.csv"
  maxLogit="12"
/>

I noticed ESM's high conviction on position 22 and 96 being C. This turned out to be a [disulfide bridge](https://www.creative-proteomics.com/resource/disulfide-bridges-proteins-formation-function-analysis.htm), important for the stability of the structure. At both positions, ESM started developing this conviction around layer 10.

There is another disulfide bridge at positions 154 - 210. ESM seems to have noticed this one starting at layer 9.
