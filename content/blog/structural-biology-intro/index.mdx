I loved Legos as a kid. Imagining and manipulating shapes – and seeing how they fit together – feels intuitive, natural, and fun. It's second nature: the sort of intelligence that babies develop long before their first word.

Shapes are also the language of biology. Reasoning about them on the level of molecules is how we discover life-changing medicines.

This blog post is a structure-first introduction to molecular biology. We'll start by looking at three structures – each a small window into vastly complex biological systems – and explore the stories behind them. My goal is to share, through these vignettes, a visceral sense of the miraculous inner workings of life, an appreciation of the beauty of molecules, and a rediscovered joy of playing with Legos.

## The leucine zipper

The leucine zipper refers to the pink and purple coils that bind to DNA, the double-helix, like a pair of chopsticks. Each coil is a chain of amino acids. Due to their chemical properties, they naturally arrange themselves into this helical shape, called an alpha-helix.

One such property is hydrophobicity. Imagine the environment around the structure, the cell, as a bag of water: water-fearing molecules want to avoid exposure and orient themselves inward. Leucine is an example of such a hydrophobic molecule.

This picture highlights leucines in red. On both coils, leucine appears at regular intervals spaced 7 positions apart. Because leucines are hydrophobic, they tend to cluster together inward. This force holds the two coils together, hence the name "leucine zipper".
