I loved Legos as a kid. Imagining and manipulating shapes – and seeing how they fit together – feels intuitive, natural, and fun. It's second nature: the sort of intelligence that babies develop long before their first word.

This intuitive language of shapes is also the language of biology. Seeing and reasoning about shapes on the level of molecules can lead to the discovery of life-saving medicines.

This blog post is a structure-first introduction to molecular biology. We'll start by looking at three structures – each a small window into the complex machinery of life – and explore the stories behind them. My goal is to share, through these vignettes, a visceral sense of the miraculous inner workings of our bodies, an appreciation of the beauty of molecules, and a rediscovered joy of playing with Legos.

## The Leucine zipper

The Leucine zipper refers to the two coils that binds to DNA, the double-helix, like a pair of chopsticks. Each coil is a chain of amino acids that, due to their chemical propensities, naturally snap into this shape, called an alpha-helix.

An important chemical propensity is hydrophobicity. We can think of the environment around this structure, the cell, as a bag of water: water-fearing molecules want to avoid being exposed and will orient themselves inward. Leucine is an example of such a hydrophobic molecule.

On both coils, leucine appears at regular intervals spaced 7 positions apart.
