Rarely in the history of medicine has a single drug created a seismic shift as profound as Keytruda, the cancer drug developed by Merck. Since its approval in 2014, Keytruda has rewritten the survival statistic of over 15 types of cancer, won a Nobel Prize, and reached $30 billion in sales last year alone.

Keytruda's story is a circuitous one of setbacks and breakthroughs, serendipity and resilience. You can read about it in this [excellent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/07/26/the-startling-history-behind-mercks-new-cancer-blockbuster/). This blog post focuses on the science of how it works, grounded in visualizations of the key molecular players. My goal is to share, though this example, a sense of wonder at the intricate inner structures of life – and how extraordinary it is that we’ve learned to influence them.

## Immune checkpoints

T cells detect and destroy cancer cells. They are tightly regulated to prevent misdirected attacks on healthy cells. For example, **PD-1** (programmed cell death protein 1) is a protein on the surface of T cells that acts like an "off-switch". When PD-1 binds to its partner protein, **PD-L1** (programmed death-ligand 1), it signals the T cell to halt its attack.

Here's a close-up of PD-L1 activating PD-1. Try the selector for some different ways to visualize the interface interactions.
