Rarely in the history of medicine has a single drug created a seismic shift as profound as Keytruda, the cancer drug developed by Merck. Since its approval in 2014, Keytruda has rewritten the survival statistic of over 15 types of cancer, won a Nobel Prize, and reached $30 billion in sales last year alone.

Keytruda's story is a circuitous one of setbacks and breakthroughs, serendipity and resilience. You can read about it in this [excellent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/07/26/the-startling-history-behind-mercks-new-cancer-blockbuster/). This blog post focuses on the science of how it works, grounded in visualizations of the key molecular players. My goal is to share, though this example, a sense of wonder at the intricate inner structures of life – and how extraordinary it is that we’ve learned to influence them.

## PD-1 & immune regulation

T cells detect and destroy cancer cells. They are tightly regulated to prevent misdirected attacks on healthy cells. For example, **PD-1** (programmed cell death protein 1) is a protein on the surface of T cells that acts like an "off-switch". When PD-1 binds to its partner protein, **PD-L1** (programmed death-ligand 1), it signals the T cell to halt its attack.

Here's a close-up of PD-L1 binding PD-1. Use the selector to try a few ways of visualization the interface interactions. Notice how the two proteins fit together: molecular recognition is governed by shape complementarity and hydrogen bonding at the interface.

What we've seen is just the extracellular portion of PD-1 and PD-L1. Both are transmembrane proteins anchored in cell membranes, with flexible tails extending into the cell interior.

Because these tails are too disordered to capture with current experimental methods...

## Keytruda blocks PD-L1

Now compare that with PD-1 bound to Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The antibody grips a broader, shifted surface on PD-1 compared with PD-L1. Toggle the interface view to see how the Keytruda footprint wraps across a different face.

Now superpose the two complexes so PD-1 stays fixed in place. Toggle the ligand to see how the Keytruda pose shifts relative to PD-L1.
