Rarely in the history of medicine has a single drug created a seismic shift as profound as Keytruda, the miracle cancer drug developed by Merck. Since its approval in 2014, Keytruda has rewritten the survival statistic of over 15 types of cancer, won a Nobel Prize, and reached $30 billion in sales last year alone.

The story behind Keytruda is a circuitous one of setbacks and breakthroughs, serendipity and resilience. You can read about it in this [excellent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/07/26/the-startling-history-behind-mercks-new-cancer-blockbuster/). In this blog post, I'll focus on the science of how it works, with some interactive illustrations of the molecular mechanisms. My goal is to share, though this example, a sense of wonder at the intricate inner workings of life – and how extraordinary it is that we’ve learned to influence them.
