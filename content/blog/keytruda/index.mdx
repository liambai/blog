Rarely in the history of medicine has a single drug created a seismic shift as profound as Keytruda, the cancer drug developed by Merck. Since its approval in 2014, Keytruda has rewritten the survival statistic of over 15 types of cancer, won a Nobel Prize, and reached $30 billion in sales last year alone.

Keytruda's story is a circuitous one of setbacks and breakthroughs, serendipity and resilience. You can read about it in this [excellent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/07/26/the-startling-history-behind-mercks-new-cancer-blockbuster/). This blog post focuses on the science of how it works, grounded in visualizations of the key molecular players. My goal is to share, though this example, a sense of wonder at the intricate inner structures of life – and how extraordinary it is that we’ve learned to influence them.

## Checks & balances in our immune system

T cells detect and destroy cancer cells. They are tightly regulated to prevent misdirected attacks on healthy cells. For example, **PD-1** (programmed cell death protein 1) is a protein on the surface of T cells that acts like an "off-switch". When PD-1 binds to its partner protein, **PD-L1** (programmed death-ligand 1), it signals the T cell to halt its attack.

</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

Here's a close-up of PD-L1 binding PD-1. Try the toggles for a few ways of visualizing the interface interactions. Notice how the two proteins fit together: molecular recognition is governed by shape complementarity and hydrogen bonding at the interface.

Above are just the extracellular portion of PD-1 and PD-L1. Both are transmembrane proteins anchored in cell membranes, with flexible tails extending into the cell interior.

Though these disordered tails elude our experimental methods of structure determination, we can guess at their structure using computational tools. Here's the [AlphaFold2 prediction](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q15116) of the full PD-1 sequence, colored by confidence (pLDDT):

</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

The extracellular binding domain and the transmembrane helix are predicted with high confidence, while the intracellular tail appears disordered with low confidence. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, subtle structural changes occur in PD-1's intracellular tail that trigger a cascade of events leading to the T cell's inactivation.

## Exploit & counter

It is perhaps unsurprising that a common strategy used by cancer cells to evade our immune system is by expressing PD-L1. Using PD-L1, cancer cells engage PD-1 and disarm the T cell.

If we can block cancer cells from activating PD-1, then we can unleash the T cell's ability to kill the cancer cells. That's the key insight behind Keytruda.

## Keytruda

Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, is an antibody that it also binds to PD-1.

  <Pd1KeytrudaViewer title="PD-1 & Keytruda interface (PDB 5B8C)" />
</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

Compared to PD-L1, Keytruda binds a shifted surface of PD-1; due to such subtle differences in the binding interaction, it does not trigger T cell inactivation. Crucially, with Keytruda bound, PD-1 is blocked from interacting with PD-L1.

Here's a comparison of the binding poses of PD-L1 vs. Keytruda. Use the toggles to switch between the two.
