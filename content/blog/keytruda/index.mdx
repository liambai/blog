Rarely in the history of medicine has a single drug created a seismic shift as profound as **Keytruda**, the cancer drug developed by Merck. Since its approval in 2014, Keytruda has rewritten the survival statistic of over 15 cancer types and become the best-selling drug in the world, reaching $30 billion in sales last year alone.

Keytruda's story is a circuitous one of setbacks and breakthroughs, serendipity and resilience. You can read about it in this [excellent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/07/26/the-startling-history-behind-mercks-new-cancer-blockbuster/). In this blog post, I'll focus on the science of how it works, grounded in visualizations of the key molecular players. My goal is to share, though this example, a sense of wonder at the intricate inner structures of life – and how extraordinary it is that we’ve learned to influence them.

## Checks & balances in our immune system

[T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell) detect and destroy cancer cells. They are tightly regulated to prevent misdirected attacks on healthy cells. For example, **PD-1** (programmed cell death protein 1)<Note id={1}/> is a protein on the surface of T cells that acts like an "off-switch". When PD-1 binds to its partner protein, **PD-L1** (programmed death-ligand 1), it signals the T cell to halt its attack.

</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

Here's a close-up of PD-L1 binding PD-1. Try the toggles for a few ways of visualizing the interface interactions. Notice how the two proteins fit together: molecular recognition is governed by shape complementarity and hydrogen bonding at the interface.

Above are just the extracellular portion of PD-1 and PD-L1. Both are transmembrane proteins anchored in cell membranes, with flexible tails extending into the cell's interior.

Though these disordered tails elude our experimental methods of structure determination, we can guess at their structure using computational tools. Here's the [AlphaFold2 prediction](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q15116) of the full PD-1 sequence, colored by confidence (pLDDT):

  <AlphafoldPd1Viewer title="PD-1 full structure predicted by AF2 (UniProt Q15116)" />
</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

The extracellular binding domain and the [transmembrane helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_domain) are predicted with high confidence, while the intracellular tail appears disordered with low confidence. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, PD-1's intracellular tail triggers a cascade of events leading to the T cell's inactivation.<Note id={3}/>

## Exploit & counter

It is perhaps unsurprising that **a common strategy cancer cells use to evade our immune system is by overexpressing PD-L1**. By doing so, they engage PD-1 on T cells and effectively disarm them.

If we can block cancer cells from activating PD-1, then we can unleash the T cell's ability to kill the cancer cells. That's the key insight behind Keytruda.

## Keytruda

Keytruda, also known as **pembrolizumab**<Note id={4}/>, is an antibody that also binds to PD-1.

<LazyVisualizationWrapper placeholder="Loading PD-1/Keytruda complex...">
  <Pd1KeytrudaViewer title="PD-1/Keytruda interface (PDB 5B8C)" />
</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

Compared to PD-L1, Keytruda binds a shifted surface of PD-1 and therefore does not trigger any downstream signaling. **Crucially, with Keytruda bound, PD-1 is blocked from interacting with PD-L1.**

Here's a comparison of the binding poses of PD-L1 vs. Keytruda. Use the toggles to switch between the two.

  <Pd1PoseOverlayViewer title="PD-1 binding PD-L1 vs. Keytruda" />
</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

The Keytruda structure above shows only the **variable fragment**, the antigen-binding tip of the Y-shaped antibody. This region is called "variable" because its sequence differs between antibodies, which in this case enables Keytruda to specifically recognize PD-1. The rest of the antibody is the **constant region**, largely identical across antibodies of a given class.

</LazyVisualizationWrapper>

Because the antibody has two arms, each Keytruda molecule can bind to two PD-1 molecules.

## The impacts of Keytruda

With the molecular mechanisms in mind, we can better understand how Keytruda reshaped cancer therapy and continues to drive key trends in the pharma industry.

1. Keytruda is the defining success story in the emerging field of **immuno-oncology**, leveraging the power of our immune system to attack cancer.
2. Keytruda pioneered biomarker-driven clinical development, accelerating the industry’s shift toward targeted therapies. During development, Merck focused on patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression – evidence of the tumor exploiting the PD-1 pathway. Although this narrowed the set of eligible patients, it delivered ground-breaking efficacy.
3. Keytruda catalyzed major regulatory innovation, including one of the first biomarker-based approvals. The FDA authorized Keytruda for all patients with the PD-L1 biomarker<Note id={2}/> _regardless of cancer type_, a significant departure from the traditional model where approvals are limited to, say, only melanoma or lung cancer.

In the end, so much of life (and life-saving medicines!) comes down to these molecular dances of shape fitting. Messy, elegant, beautiful – like the dance between PD-1 and PD-L1, evolved over millions of years, hijacked by cancer, and now outmaneuvered by human ingenuity.
